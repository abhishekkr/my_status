# MyStatus

> It's a simple sample web app created in Phoenix with purpose to learn & teach Phoenix Framework and LiveView workings.

*This was created as part of a Phoenix LiveView tutorial series, available [here](https://abhishekkr.github.io/blog.html#/blogs/2022-12-31-elixir-phoenix-liveview-getting-started.md).*

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
